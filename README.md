Hey team, this is an isolated verison of our open source project.
You can tinker with this code as much as you like, the goal is to mess around and get comfortable with github and its' features.
Feel free to Dm me via slack if you need help with anything.
-----------------------------------------------
Based on the other team's commmits to the project, we only had to edit the src/server/test/web/readingsBarMeterQuantity.js and add the csv file that contains expected values of B12.

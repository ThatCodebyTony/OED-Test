Hey team, this is an isolated verison of our open source project.
You can tinker with this code as much as you like, the goal is to mess around and get comfortable with github and it's features.
Feel free to Dm me via slack if you need help with anything.
-----------------------------------------------
1- src/server/test/web/readingsBarMeterQuantity.js is the code we are working on, Thanks Arthur for finding it!

2- We are told to compare the data from "B12" with expected values.

3 - B12 is "readings_ri_15_days_76.csv" 

4 - I uploaded both "readings_ri_15_days_76.csv" and "README.md" from the DesignDoc.
